# SHA256 Hash Converter Thingy

This C# console application takes a string input from the user, hashes it using SHA256, and then outputs the hashed value into a text file generated by the program.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Using the command line or terminal, navigate to the directory containing the C# source code files.

3. **Build the Application**: Use your preferred method to build the application. If you're using Visual Studio, you can simply open the solution file and build it from there.

4. **Run the Application**: Execute the built executable file.

5. **Enter a String to Hash**: When prompted, enter the string you want to hash.

6. **Find the Output File**: Once the program has finished running, you will find a text file in the same directory as the executable file. The file will be named `HashOutput_<timestamp>.txt`, where `<timestamp>` represents the current date and time.

7. **View the Hashed String**: Open the generated text file to view the hashed string. The file will contain both the original string and its corresponding SHA256 hash.

## Requirements

- .NET Framework or .NET Core SDK installed on your machine.
- A C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code with C# extension).

## Implementation Details

- The program uses the `SHA256` class from the `System.Security.Cryptography` namespace to compute the hash of the input string.
- The hashed string is then written to a text file using `StreamWriter`.
- The filename for the output file is generated based on the current timestamp to ensure uniqueness.
